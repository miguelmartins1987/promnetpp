# Introduction #

This article constitutes a guide that is meant to provide instructions on using the PROMNeT++ Plug-in for Eclipse.

# Prerequisites #

  * It is assumed that the plug-in has been correctly installed. If not, consult [this article](InstallingPROMNeTppPlugin.md) for installation instructions.

# Phase 1 - Creating your project #

  1. If not open already, launch the OMNeT++ IDE, via the standard _omnetpp_ command.
  1. Select File|New|OMNeT++ Project...
  1. Give your project a name. We'll be performing a translation of the _OneThirdRule_ protocol during this guide.<br><br><img src='https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/NewOmnetppProjectOneThirdRule.png' />
<ol><li>Proceed to the next page of the New OMNeT++ Project wizard, and choose <i>Empty project</i> as your template.<br><br><img src='https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/CreateEmptyProject.png' />
</li><li>Finish the project's creation by clicking on the <i>Finish</i> button.<br>
<ul><li>Alternatively, should you have any need to alter the toolchains and/or configurations for your project proceed to the next pages of the wizard and make any changes you desire. I suspect most users do not need to do this, however.</li></ul></li></ol>

<h1>Phase 2 - Perform the PROMELA to C++ translation via the plug-in</h1>

<ol><li>First and foremost, delete the <i>package.ned</i> file generated by OMNeT++, as it will not only not be necessary, but will also conflict with the <i>network.ned</i> file generated by PROMNeT++ if present.<br>
</li><li>Add your PROMELA model (usually, a file with a <i>.pml</i> extension) to the project's root directory. There's a number of ways to do this, for instance, by dragging and dropping the file onto the project's folder under the Project Explorer.<br><br><img src='https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/AddPMLFileToProjectExplorer.png' />
</li><li>When right-clicking on a file with a <i>.pml</i> extension, a new sub-menu labelled <i>PROMNeT++</i> will appear. Simply select this sub-menu, followed by the <i>Translate to C++ code</i> option.<br><br><img src='https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/PromnetppPluginOption.png' />
</li><li>You will be presented with the following one-page wizard:<br><br><img src='https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/PromnetppPluginWizard.png' />
<ul><li><b>promnetpp.jar location:</b> must point to the location of PROMNeT++'s JAR file<br>
</li><li><b>PROMNETPP_HOME</b>
<ul><li><b>Same as the location of the JAR file:</b> makes it so that, for example, if promnetpp.jar is located at /some/directory/promnetpp/promnetpp.jar, PROMNETPP_HOME is set to /some/directory/promnetpp. <i>It is recommended that users go with this option unless it is strictly necessary to set the PROMNETPP_HOME environment variable manually (in which case, see the option below).</i>
</li><li><b>Other (please specify):</b> manually sets the value of the PROMNETPP_HOME variable. It is particularly useful for situations where the JAR file is in a completely different location from the remaining distribution files (such as during development with NetBeans).<br>
</li></ul></li><li><b>Configuration file</b>
<ul><li><b>Use default configuration file:</b> makes it so that PROMNeT++ uses the default-configuration.xml file under <code>&lt;</code>PROMNETPP_HOME<code>&gt;</code>/default-configuration.xml<br>
</li><li><b>Specify manually:</b> allows the user to use their own, custom configuration file. <i>Do note, however, that if you choose this option, it is required that you create/copy said custom configuration file to the same project as your PROMELA model.</i>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Once you have adjusted the wizard's settings to your liking, click on the <i>Finish</i> button. You will be presented with a window similar to the one below.<br><br><img src='https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/PromnetppPluginMessageWindow.png' />
</li><li>The window above refreshes itself continuously to notify you (the user) of any progress that's been made. Once PROMNeT++ is finished (whether it succeeded or failed), the <i>Close</i> button at the bottom may be clicked to close the window.
