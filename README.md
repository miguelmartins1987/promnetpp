# PROMNeT++
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/promnetpp

At its core, this project consists of a Java-powered tool that parses and translates PROMELA (http://spinroot.com/) code, to C++ code that is intended to be runnable under OMNeT++ (http://www.omnetpp.org/).

This project's original development cycle is associated with University of Coimbra's Informatics Engineering Department ("Departamento de Engenharia Informática", http://www.uc.pt/fctuc/dei/) and is part of an internship (from Portuguese "estágio") performed in it.

The main purpose of this project is tied to research on generating source code from formal models; programmers are encouraged to build on it if they so desire.
