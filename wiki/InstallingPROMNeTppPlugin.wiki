= Introduction =

Although not strictly necessary to use PROMNeT++, the plug-in allows for direct translation inside the OMNeT++ IDE. This guide currently illustrates its installation procedure under a Windows environment; however, installation under any other environment should be very similar, if not practically equal.

= Method 1 - Installing the plugin via manual download =

  # Head over to the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/promnetpp/downloads/list">_Downloads_</a> page and download the latest _promnetpp-plugin-x.y.z.zip_ file, where _x.y.z_ corresponds to the latest version number. _Do not extract the zip file's contents, as it is unecessary._
  # Open the OMNeT++ IDE, then select Help|Install New Software...<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/InstallNewSoftware.png
  # Click on the _Add..._ button located to the right of the Available Software Sites dropdown box.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/AvailableSoftwareSites.png
  # We will be adding the plugin's "repository" directly from the zip archive. Do this by clicking on the _Archive..._ button, browsing to the zip file's location, and selecting it.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/ArchiveButton.png<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/BrowseToZipFile.png
  # The _Location_ field should now point to the directory where the archive selected in the previous step is located. It is always preceded by  _jar:file:_ and is delimited by an exclamation mark (!) at the end. An example of this would be _jar:file:/C:/tmp/promnetpp-plugin-0.0.1.zip!/_, as per the screenshot above. Click _OK_ to confirm.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/ArchiveLocationClickOK.png
  # If done correctly, an entry for the plugin should appear. Confirm that you want to install the plugin by marking the entry's checkbox and clicking on the _Next >_ button.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/MarkTheCheckboxAndClickNext.png
