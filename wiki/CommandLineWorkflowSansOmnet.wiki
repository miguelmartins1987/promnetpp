= Introduction =

If you're a researcher (or perhaps my internship's supervisor https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/smiley-face-md-16px.png), then you might not care about OMNeT++ at all, but are interested instead in either analyzing how PROMNeT++ generates code and/or want to reuse said code. This is the case for a number of researchers out there, who would like to run the code in real-time systems.

This Wiki page is probably very similar to CommandLineWorkflow1, and should also be regarded as a guide to perform a PROMELA to C++ translation via the command line, *but it will not make use of OMNeT++ at all.*

= Prerequisites for this Workflow =

  * PROMNeT++ (its JAR file and any other files that come with its standard distribution) must have been extracted to a directory of your choice; this guide will assume _C:\promnetpp_ as said directory.
    * If you haven't done so already, head over to the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/promnetpp/downloads/list">_Downloads_</a> page and download the latest PROMNeT++ release (PROMNeT++ Alpha 2 as of this guide's time of writing).
    * The screenshot below illustrates the contents of PROMNeT++'s standard distribution.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/Distribution1.png
