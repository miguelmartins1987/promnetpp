= Introduction =

If you're a researcher (or perhaps my internship's supervisor https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/smiley-face-md-16px.png), then you might not care about OMNeT++ at all, but are interested instead in either analyzing how PROMNeT++ generates code and/or want to reuse said code. This is the case for a number of researchers out there, who would like to run the code in real-time systems.

This Wiki page is probably very similar to CommandLineWorkflow1, and should also be regarded as a guide to perform a PROMELA to C++ translation via the command line, *but it will not make use of OMNeT++ at all.*
