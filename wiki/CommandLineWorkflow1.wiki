#summary Basic usage of PROMNeT++ via the command line

= Introduction =

Like many Java applications, PROMNeT++ is distributed, in binary form, as a JAR file. This Wiki page shall serve as a guide to perform a PROMELA to C++ translation via the command line, under a Windows environment. For most modern operating systems (such as recent Linux distributions or OS X), the procedure detailed below should (hopefully) be almost the same, with minor variants.

= Prerequisites for this Workflow =

  * OMNeT++ must be installed.
    * For this guide, OMNeT++ is installed under _C:\omnetpp-4.3_

  * OMNeT++ must be fully functional, meaning it must be possible to launch its IDE via the standard _omnetpp_ command. Furthermore, it must be possible to run simulations, preferrably using OMNeT++'s graphical simulation environment (Tkenv).
    * We will resort to both OMNeT++'s IDE and graphical simulation environment later on.
    * Most samples that come with OMNeT++'s distribution should suffice when determining whether or not is possible to perform a graphical simulation.

= Steps =

  # Navigate to your OMNeT++ workspace directory. By default, assuming OMNeT++ is installed under _C:\omnetpp-4.3_, said workspace directory is located under under _C:\omnetpp-4.3\samples_
  # Create a new folder for your (soon to be) OMNeT++ project, in this case, _OneThirdRule_ <br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/ScreenshotGoesHere.png
  # Navigate to the folder you just created and copy the PROMELA model (typically, a file with a _.pml_ extension) that is to be submitted for translation to it.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/CopyPMLFile.png
