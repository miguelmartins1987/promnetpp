= Introduction =

This article constitutes a guide that is meant to provide instructions on using the PROMNeT++ Plug-in for Eclipse.

= Prerequisites =

  * It is assumed that the plug-in has been correctly installed. If not, consult [InstallingPROMNeTppPlugin this article] for installation instructions.

= Phase 1 - Creating your project =

  # If not open already, launch the OMNeT++ IDE, via the standard _omnetpp_ command.
  # Select File|New|OMNeT++ Project...
  # Give your project a name. We'll be performing a translation of the _!OneThirdRule_ protocol during this guide.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/NewOmnetppProjectOneThirdRule.png
  # Proceed to the next page of the New OMNeT++ Project wizard, and choose _Empty project_ as your template.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/CreateEmptyProject.png
  # Finish the project's creation by clicking on the _Finish_ button.
    * Alternatively, should you have any need to alter the toolchains and/or configurations for your project proceed to the next pages of the wizard and make any changes you desire. I suspect most users do not need to do this, however.
