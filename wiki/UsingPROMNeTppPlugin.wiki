= Introduction =

This article constitutes a guide that is meant to provide instructions on using the PROMNeT++ Plug-in for Eclipse.

= Prerequisites =

  * It is assumed that the plug-in has been correctly installed. If not, consult [InstallingPROMNeTppPlugin this article] for installation instructions.

= Phase 1 - Creating your project =

  # If not open already, launch the OMNeT++ IDE, via the standard _omnetpp_ command.
  # Select File|New|OMNeT++ Project...
  # Give your project a name. We'll be performing a translation of the _!OneThirdRule_ protocol during this guide.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/NewOmnetppProjectOneThirdRule.png
  # Proceed to the next page of the New OMNeT++ Project wizard, and choose _Empty project_ as your template.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/CreateEmptyProject.png
  # Finish the project's creation by clicking on the _Finish_ button.
    * Alternatively, should you have any need to alter the toolchains and/or configurations for your project proceed to the next pages of the wizard and make any changes you desire. I suspect most users do not need to do this, however.

= Phase 2 - Perform the PROMELA to C++ translation via the plug-in =

  # First and foremost, delete the _package.ned_ file generated by OMNeT++, as it will not only not be necessary, but will also conflict with the _network.ned_ file generated by PROMNeT++ if present.
  # Add your PROMELA model (usually, a file with a _.pml_ extension) to the project's root directory. There's a number of ways to do this, for instance, by dragging and dropping the file onto the project's folder under the Project Explorer.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/AddPMLFileToProjectExplorer.png
  # When right-clicking on a file with a _.pml_ extension, a new sub-menu labelled _PROMNeT++_ will appear. Simply select this sub-menu, followed by the _Translate to C++ code_ option.<br><br>https://promnetpp.googlecode.com/svn/media/PromnetppPluginOption.png
